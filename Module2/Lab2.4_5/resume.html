            <h2 class="section-title">Hello Everyone!</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is John. I am a student in the Software Engineering class at IOD and work fulltime as a Relief Clinical Manager, and Infection Control Lead in a residential aged care facility. 
            
            It's a big jump for me but I'm currently trying to do a career change and expanding my horizons, I have decided to follow my passion for technology

            <h3>Healthcare Experience</h3>
            <picture>
              I have a comprehensive background in nursing, with six years of studiesâ€”two years in Australia and four years in the Philippines. My three years of geriatric nursing experience cover palliative care, wound care, medication management, and clinical assessments. I have also completed postgraduate studies in Infection Prevention Control, during which I developed a facility-specific outbreak management plan.
            <p>
            <h3>IT Experience</h3>
            My IT journey began in high school, where I built a simple website using HTML and gained experience with Linux OS. I am proficient in Office tools like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, and I effectively use Health Metric Systems (Ecase) in my current role. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of both Mac and Windows operating systems. Cure
