# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Exercises Overview

**Exercise 6 - Calculator App**  
   - This folder contains the solution for the basic calculator component.  
   - **Adaptation**: The calculator app was adapted from the version created in Module 4. This version includes improvements based on the new exercise requirements.
   - The calculator accepts two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and displays the result. Check `Calculator.jsx` for the main logic.
