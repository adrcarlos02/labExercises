# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. **Exercise 1**  
   - The solution to the first exercise can be found in this folder, addressing the requirements specified.

2. **Exercise 2**  
   - This folder includes the solution to the second exercise, with the necessary adjustments and implementations.

3. **Exercise 3**  
   - The third exercise builds upon previous work, and the solution is contained here.

4. **Exercise 4**  
   - The fourth exercise introduces more features, and its solution is organized in this folder.

5. **Exercise 5**  
   - This folder contains the answer to the fifth exercise, continuing from the concepts applied in the previous exercises.


6. **Exercise 6 - Calculator App**  
   - This folder contains the solution for the basic calculator component.  
   - **Adaptation**: The calculator app was adapted from the version created in Module 4. This version includes improvements based on the new exercise requirements.
   - The calculator accepts two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and displays the result. Check `Calculator.jsx` for the main logic.
