Lab #1: Figma

Create a Figma prototype for a social media application, where you can post your content and posts from other users are visible. Donâ€™t just jump into Figma, try to follow the design procedure.


Also, this could be part of your portfolio, so try to do some research and come up with a personal design. For example, it could be a social media application dedicated to the Warhammer Community, or the Ferrari Lovers.
