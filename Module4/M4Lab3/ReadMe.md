Calculator application planning

Step 1 : Requirements
- The calculator needs two numbers to perform calculations (like 5 and 10).
- It should allow you to pick an operator (+, -, *, or /)
- When you press the “equals” button, it should show the result of the calculation.
- When you press the “reset” button, it should clear the input and result.


Step 2: Visualisation
- It should have buttons for digits (0-9), the four operators (+, -, *, /), an equals (=) button to calculate, and a reset (C or AC) button to clear the screen.
- You will also need a display to show the numbers you input and the results.

Step 3: Simple flow Diagram
	
- User presses number buttons → Numbers appear on the screen.

- User presses an operator button → Operator is remembered.

- User presses the equals button → Result appears on the screen.

- Reset: User presses the reset button → Screen clears, and the calculator resets.
